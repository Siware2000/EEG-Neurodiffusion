Topology-Preserving Diffusion Models for EEG Topomaps and Cognitive Load Classification

EEG-Neurodiffusion is a research-grade framework for diffusion-based generative modeling of EEG scalp topographic maps (topomaps), with a focus on topology preservation, controlled data augmentation, and robust cognitive load classification under subject-independent evaluation.
